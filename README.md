This is just a collection of simple tutorials, howtos and notes on various configurations.

## Why turbo-guide?

In the past years, both for work and as a hobby, I've been collecting notes on various technical topics, mainly connected to software development. 
One day I was creating a new repository on [github](https://github.com/), the 'Need inspiration?' feature suggesting names for the repository to be
created presented me the name 'turbo-guide', it was like an 'epiphany' and I decided to start putting some of the notes I was collecting in a form that
(hopefully) could be helpful for others too.
